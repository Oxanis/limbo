	<h1>Level 1</h1>
	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
		Level 1 takes the form of empty office hallways with off-white colored walls made of wood. Pipes can be heard running through walls, however when broken down, the walls seem to be absent of machinery.
		It has a green, dry carpet on the floor throughout the level, and a regular pattern of fluorescent ceiling lights that seem to generate no buzz. It is the first level people enter when falling in limbo, and although it is proven to be safe,
		it is the source of many deaths from people inexperienced in survival, due to sparse loot with no exit guidance or experience. Measurements estimate the total area of the level to be comparable to that of Earth's, so encountering other survivors here is unlikely
		unless you enter as a group. Occasionally, one may find a room sometimes housing containers of resources, most importantly food and water. If a part of a wall has water damage, it can be broken down to reveal a secret room
	</p>
	<h2>Communities</h2>
	<h3>L.I.M.O outpost 1</h3>
	<p>
		A large outpost on level 1, used for exploring for other wanderers and bringing them in before an untimely death. Rather small with few permanent residents due to level 1's shortage of exits and barren rescources
	</p>
	<h2>Known Exits</h2>
	<p>
		Level 1 has a variety of different exits, however they are sparse so encountering them is a difficult task. Known common exits include exits to <a href="/levels/3">Level 3</a> via an elevator, <a href="/levels/5">Level 5</a> via a vent hatch, and <a href="/levels/17">Level 17</a> via a ladder in a loot room.
