<h1>Level 1</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Level 1 takes the form of empty office hallways with off-white colored walls made of wood. Pipes can be heard running through walls, however when broken down, the walls seem to be absent of machinery.
  It has a green, dry carpet on the floor throughout the level, and a regular pattern of fluorescent ceiling lights that seem to generate no buzz. It is the 1st level people enter when falling in limbo, and so although is proven to be safe,
  is the scource of many deaths from people inexperienced in survival, due to sparce loot with no exit guidance or experience. Measurements Estimate the area of the level to be comparable to that of earth's, so encountering other survivours here is unlikely
  unless you enter as a group.</p>
