<h1>Level 1</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Level 1 takes the form of empty office hallways with off-white colored walls made of wood. Pipes can be heard running through walls but when breaking down walls, none can be found.
  It has a green, dry carpet on the floor throughout the level, and a regular pattern of fluorescent ceiling lights that seem to generate no buzz. It is the 1st level people enter when falling in limbo, and so although is proven to be safe,
  is the scource of many deaths from people inexperienced in survival, due to sparce loot and no exit guidance or experience.</p>
